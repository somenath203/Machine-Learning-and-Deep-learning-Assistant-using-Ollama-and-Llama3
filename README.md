# Machine Learning and Deep learning Assistant using Ollama and Llama3

This is a simple Question Answering application created with the help of `Langchain`, `Ollama`, `Llama3 Large Language Model` and `Streamlit` that answer questions and produce code related to machine learning and deep learning.

## Note
Since, Llama3 is running locally via Ollama, therefore, it takes some time for the model to generate response.
